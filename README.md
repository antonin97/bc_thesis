# Running the code locally in the Jupyter Notebook Environment

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies for running the Jupyter notebooks, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```sh
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the requirements**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Inside the Jupyter Notebook run Local environment part, NOT the Google Colab environment part**
